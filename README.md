# Low-environment-light Nighttime Vehicle Detection Training Dataset
### This dataset can be used only for research purposes. ###

This dataset contains nighttime images under low-environment-light conditions, they could be used for the purpose of training models for nighttime vehicle detection.


The folder "<a href="./train examples">train examples</a>" contains some samples of our dataset for demonstration.

## Nighttime vehicle video detection example:
This video clip shows the vehicle detection result of the model trained with the images enhanced by our proposed contrast enhancement method.
The full video could be found under the root folder or by clicking <a href="./Low-Light-Detection-Output.mp4">Low-Light-Detection-Output.mp4</a>.
